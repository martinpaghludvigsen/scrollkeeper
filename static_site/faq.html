<h1>FAQ</h1><br />
<strong>My ScrollKeeper doesn't seem to work, whatcha gonna do about it?</strong><br />
Once installed, ScrollKeeper starts working when you refresh the web page you're on, or for every new web page you enter from now on. It works by adding a tiny bit of JavaScript to every page you enter. Some web sites don't like having code added to them, so there are cases where ScrollKeeper won't work, but based on our testing it works on 95% of all sites.
<br /><br />
<strong>Is this going to harm my computer in any way?</strong><br />
No, the ScrollKeeper only measures your scrolling distance, that's it. And it's easy to uninstall if you don't like it.
<br /><br />
<strong>What is ScrollKeeper landmarks?</strong><br />
A bunch of easter eggs that will keep you motivated to keep scrolling. For instance, when you've scrolled 112 kilometres, we'll inform you that it's equal to the longest solo swim ever. You'll be filled with pride and tell yourself "My father should see me now".
<br /><br />
<strong>Do you collect my scrolling data?</strong><br />
Nope, we can't see how far any individual ScrollKeeper user is scrolling. If you really must let us know, post your distance to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Scroll-Keeper/278219568972683?fref=ts">Facebook-page</a>.
<br /><br />
<strong>How do I uninstall it?</strong><br />
Just go to Window – Extensions, then click Remove on the right side of the ScrollKeeper extension. Voila, now you have no idea of how far you're scrolling.
<br /><br />
<strong>I couldn't help to notice that the interface is mirrored the wrong way on the website?</strong><br />
Ok, that's not a question.

<strong>Are there any world records in scrolling?</strong><br />
The last landmark we have for ScrollKeeper is 384 403 kilometres (238 857 miles). We'll crown the first person to post a screenshot of that landmark as the World Champion.
